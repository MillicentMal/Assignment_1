Answer to Question One


State the Big O-notation and implement the algorithm that perform the following operations: 

The algorithm takes as input a list of numbers which may contain duplicates. It returns true if all elements of the list occur an odd number of times. Otherwise it returns false. For example, on the list {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2} it returns true, but on the list {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5} it returns false because 5 occurs an even number of times. [5]

The time complexity for the algorithm is O(n)

This is because using the count() function, we iterate through the list, for every item in the list, checking for equivalence and then incrementing that object's count. 

So the time complexity is O(n), n being the length of list/ number of items in the list.
